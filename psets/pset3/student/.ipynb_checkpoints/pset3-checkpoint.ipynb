    "Upon arrival, however, Maria's situation turns out very differently. Her employers confiscate her passport and work visa, telling her it’s for “safe-keeping.” Maria is made to work 14-16 hours a day, seven days a week, cleaning the house, cooking, and caring for the children, with no days off. She sleeps on a mattress in a small utility room, is provided minimal food, and is prohibited from leaving the house without permission.\n",

    "The family threatens Maria, telling her that if she tries to escape or report her situation, they will contact immigration authorities and have her deported. She is paid far less than was initially promised—sometimes nothing at all—leaving her trapped and unable to send money home as planned.\n",
    "\n",
    "Over time, Maria’s physical and mental health deteriorates due to overwork, isolation, and abuse. She is kept from accessing outside help and doesn’t know the language or her rights in the U.S. Eventually, she manages to confide in a neighbor or a delivery worker, who notices the signs of exploitation and reports the situation to authorities. An investigation is launched, and the results of the investigation remain unknown."

They are paid far less than the minimum wage, often receiving less than promised or not being paid at all. If the workers protest or try to leave, the contractor threatens them with deportation or physical violence, or claims that they still owe recruitment debts.\n",
