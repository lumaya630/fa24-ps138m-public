Her employers confiscate her passport and work visa, telling her it’s for “safe-keeping.” Maria is made to work 14-16 hours a day, seven days a week, cleaning the house, cooking, and caring for the children, with no days off. She sleeps on a mattress in a small utility room, is provided minimal food, and is prohibited from leaving the house without permission.\n",

She is kept from accessing outside help and doesn’t know the language or her rights in the U.S. Eventually, she manages to confide in a neighbor or a delivery worker, who notices the signs of exploitation and reports the situation to authorities.
