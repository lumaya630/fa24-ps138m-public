    "Hello! Welcome to PS 138M. To keep up with the increasing prevalence of data in addressing social issues such as human trafficking, we are introducing a dual track assignment system where you can choose to complete either the data intensive assignment or the writing intensive assignment, based on your own personal goals for this course. Both tracks will have a basic data component, as all students in this class should have a basic level of data proficiency. The assignments diverges when it comes to the more complex tasks. To be clear, you only need to choose **ONE** track. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Notes\n",
    "* Most of the **data** questions in this problem set will be automatically graded. Therefore, you need to answer the questions exactly as we asked them: if we ask you to compute something, write the code to compute that exact value.\n",
    "    * Some of the coding questions below will tell you if you have the right or wrong answer if you run your code and then run the `ottr::check` cell just below it. (The multiple choice questions do not do this.)\n",
    "    * You'll know you got a question right if it says \"All tests passed!\" afterwards.\n",
    "    * If you see an error when you run the check cell, it means you got the question wrong and should try again. The question should show a hint.\n",
    "    * If you don't see anything when you run the check cell, this means the question doesn't tell you if you got the right or wrong answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Short answer questions** will be graded by a GSI. For these questions:\n",
    "    * We expect around 2-3 sentences on average. You just need to write enough to answer the question, don't stress about how short your answer is.\n",
    "    * To encourage you not to write too much, your GSI will only mark the first 60 words to your answer. For many of these questions, you do not need to write all 60 words.\n",
    "    \n",
    "* To make sure you completed all the required parts of this assignment, `Command` + `F` \"to do\". All parts in which you should have taken some action will be labeled with \"to do\". "
