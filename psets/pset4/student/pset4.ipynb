    "Let's first return to our semi-trusty advisor ChatGPT and see what it would recommend. I asked ChatGPT \"What criteria should USAID take when expanding anti-human trafficking efforts? Based on these criteria, what country in the world should the US expand counter trafficking efforts in?\" It responded:\n",
    "\n",
    "> When expanding anti-human trafficking efforts, USAID should consider several criteria to ensure that resources are allocated effectively and that initiatives are tailored to address specific needs in different contexts. Key criteria may include:\n",
    ">1. **Prevalence of Human Trafficking**: Assess the extent of human trafficking in potential target countries, including the number of victims and the types of trafficking (sex trafficking, labor trafficking, etc.).\n",
    "2. **Legal and Policy Framework**: Evaluate the country's laws, regulations, and enforcement measures related to human trafficking, including the prosecution of traffickers and protection of victims.\n",
    "3. **Government Commitment**: Look for a demonstrated commitment from the country's government to combating human trafficking, including the allocation of resources and political will to implement necessary changes.\n",
    "4. **Civil Society Engagement**: Consider the strength and activity of civil society organizations working against trafficking and their ability to work with the government.\n",
    "5. **Vulnerability Factors**: Analyze social, economic, and political factors that contribute to vulnerability, such as poverty, conflict, lack of education, and gender inequality.\n",
    "6. **Existing Support Mechanisms**: Identify any existing efforts by other countries or organizations in the region that could be built upon or complemented.\n",
    "7. **Regional Trends**: Consider regional dynamics, including human trafficking routes, and how transnational issues may affect trafficking patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    ">Based on these criteria, one country that could be considered for expanded anti-human trafficking efforts is **India**. India has high prevalence levels of human trafficking, driven by socio-economic factors such as poverty and gender inequality. While there are laws in place to combat trafficking, enforcement can be inconsistent. Additionally, there is a vibrant civil society that is active in addressing these issues, which can support expanded efforts. \n",
    "\n",
    "> Overall, the selection should be based on comprehensive research and assessment to identify where USAID's support would be most effective in reducing human trafficking.\n",
