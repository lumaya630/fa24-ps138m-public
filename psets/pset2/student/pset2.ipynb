    "conducted by Cho, Dreher, and Neumayer in 2012 that investigates the relationship between legalized prostitution and human trafficking. The goal is for you to be able to run a simplified version of their regression and have your own critical interpretation of the output. **Make sure to read the study.**\n",

    "1) Running regressions using `lm()`\n",

    "Make sure you do not change the chunk type. You can change a chunk type by clicking on the dropdown menu next to the \"forward\" button or restart kernal button. Please post any questions on edX. A lot of working with coding is sometimes just going back to look for typos or being very precise with data transformations and the set of information put into the next box. Even one period or syntactical error can throw off the code! Make sure to use exact column names so that the code will pass all tests!\n",
