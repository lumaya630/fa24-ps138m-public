    "***<p style=\"background-color: lightyellow;\">Note: In the HT world, there are multiple ways to go about measuring prevalence, each with their own pros and cons. For the purposes of this assignment, we are basing this decision off of data from the GSI estimates of prevalence. Keep in mind that in the real world, you should be skeptical and critical of how the organization went about estimating HT prevalence. There will be more on different measurements and how to interpret them later in the semester.***\n",
