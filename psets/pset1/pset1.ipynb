    "What does human trafficking look like? In class, we've gone through readings that describe and analyze the practice. In this assignment, we will supplement our existing knowledge using data. The increasing emphasis on  data in society and the social sciences has created a new demand for us to have the skills and active practice of thinking critically through how others interpret data, to double check their work, and to be able to draw conclusions from data ourselves. \n",
